        <h2>&#8227; &nbsp;Sports</h2>
        <p>
            I really love sports. It may be from watching it or playing the actual sport. For me, it gives me joy in doing and learning it. Personally I play basketball, volleyball, frisbee,
            table tennis, chess, swimming, and a little bit of soccer. But my main sport has to be basketball, and it is also the reason why I can't play any of these sports right now, because I had an 
            ACL surgery, and currently recovering from it. It sucks because I haven't been able to play competitive basketball for almost 5 years now, but nowadays, I can play slowly, and I am hopeful
            that I can recover from it fully. While I can't play, I love watching highlights, news, or updates from the world of sports. I am very active when it comes to NBA basketball. My favorite team
            currently is the Golden State Warriors, because I am a huge fan of Stephen Curry. I find him as the best pointguard there is. Let me share a list of athletes in various different sports that I
            admire because of their talent in their respective sports, and the life they have outside the court or field.
            <ul>
                <li> Kobe Bryant (Basketball) </li>
                <li> Michael Jordan (Basketball) </li>
                <li> Stephen Curry (Basketball) </li>
                <li> Michael Phelps (Swimming) </li>
                <li> Serena Williams (Tennis) </li>
                <li> Fan Zhendong (Table Tennis) </li>
                <li> Lionel Messi (Soccer/Football) </li>
                <li> Neymar Jr. (Soccer/Football) </li>
                <li> Giannis Antetokounmpo (Basketball) </li>
                <li> Kyrie Irving (Basketball) </li>
                <li> Manny Pacquiao (Boxing) </li>

            </ul>
            <br>
            Theses are just some of the list of the athletes that I admire and find them really good at their respective sports. Currently, I am trying to get in the world of American Football.

        <h2>&#8227; &nbsp;Music</h2>
        <p>
            My life is boring without music. Whether I am at work, or doing an assignment, or going to the gym, I always bring my headhpones with me to listen to music. When it comes
            to music, I am all about the rythm and the beat, whatever the meaning of the song is if the rythm is good, I will listen to it. Other thing is that, for me, a good music is
            when it is pure voice and instruments, no auto-tune, like pure talent is the best. I listen to different kinds of genre. Music helps me everyday. Now, I wanna share some of the artists 
            or bands that I love listening to.
            <ul>
                <li> Bruno Mars </li>
                <li> One Direction </li>
                <li> The Beatles </li>
                <li> Bread </li>
                <li> Ed Sheeran </li>
                ..... and many more

            </ul>

        <h2>&#8227; &nbsp;Video Games</h2>
        <p>
            Video games is what I do in my free time. I love playing video games. I say FPS (first person shooter) is the kind of game I play a lot. I started playing video games when I was in gradeschool.
            I play CounterStrike, Special Forces, NBA2k, and currently active in Valorant, which is an FPS game. I also love exploring different games like DOTA 2, Overwatch, and there are more that I want
            to try as well. Playing video games, specially in my free time, helps myself relax from my stress (even though the games itself is stressful). Because whenever I play video games, I always play 
            with my friends, it kind of making some sort of bonding moment for us, which is really nice.
