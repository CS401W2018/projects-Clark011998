                Ever since I was a young boy, I always have passion for sports. It was so interesting that I want to try every sports that there is. When I was in elementary, I was active in track and field, and table tennis. I tried out for the school's track and field team, and also for the table tennis team, I was not able to get in, but the experience I had was incredible. When I was in highschool, I was able to practice more my volleyball skills, swimming skills, and frisbee skills. And when I was on my mission and after I went home, I was focused more on my table tennis skills. I may not have made it to a varsity team on these various type of sports, I would say that I still love doing it in a competitive manner. I would say I am a pretty fast learner when it comes to learning sports, and I have no regrets learning it because I can still use it nowadays.

                Due to the injury I had when I was on my mission, it has been 5 years that I have played a sports in a competitive way. I am still recovering, but I know that someday I would be able to be back 100%. Despite this, I still enjoy the world of sports through watching it online or even live. The fun and joy I feel is the same. Watching higlights of different kind of sports makes me happy, and I would never stop loving sports.
