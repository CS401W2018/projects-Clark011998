    <h1> Aloha! My name is <em> Clark Jules Cabrera </em> </h1>
    <h2>And in this page, you will know a little more about me! </h2>
    <hr>
    <p> I was born and raised in the southern part of Philippines called <mark>Tagum City</mark>. We are six in the family, and I am second among the four siblings. My father, me, my older brother, and my younger sister
        all served a mission, and our youngest sibling is also preparing to serve a mission. My older brother, Joshua is a graduate of Brigham Young University - Hawaii last 2019, and he now has his own family
        with two cute little babies. It has always been a dream of mine to study here in BYU-H since I was in my youth days, and now that I am here, it still feels unreal. My major is Information Technology minoring 
        in Pacific Island Studies. I have always love computers and technology growing up, and made up my mind why not make it a career.  
    
        <br> <br> I really love sports, basketball is my main sport </p>
