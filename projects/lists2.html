    <h1> Aloha! My name is <em> Clark Jules Cabrera </em> </h1>
    <h2><strong>And in this page, you will know a little more about me!</strong> </h2>
    <hr>
    <p> I was born and raised in the southern part of Philippines called <mark>Tagum City</mark>. We are six in the family, and I am second among the four siblings. My father, me, my older brother, and my younger sister
        all served a mission, and our youngest sibling is also preparing to serve a mission. My older brother is a graduate of Brigham Young University - Hawaii last 2019, and he now has his own family
        with two cute little babies. It has always been a dream of mine to study here in BYU-H since I was in my youth days, and now that I am here, it still feels unreal. My major is Information Technology minoring 
        in Pacific Island Studies. I have always love computers and technology growing up, and made up my mind why not make it a career.  
    
        <br> <br> I really love sports, basketball is my main sport, and I also play frisbee, volleyball, table tennis, and swimming. But unfortunately
        I can't do any of that stuff right now because of my ACL surgery, but I am looking forward to do everything again once I recover.
        I also love to play video games. I love watching movies, and I also love listening to music, it gives me energy to do things.  </p>

    <p> Let me share a quote that my parents always say to me everytime I am going through some hardships. It is also, the favorite line of the former U.S. President, Abraham Lincoln </p>

    <blockquote>
        <em><strong>"This too shall pass"</strong></em>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>- <em>Abraham Lincoln</em> </h2>
