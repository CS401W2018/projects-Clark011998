           Everytime I get asked about this question, a lot of person I know always come to my mind. Personally, I will say it has to be Kobe Bryant.
           Aside from the fact that he is really good in playing basketball, he is also a great example on how to get focused, chase your dreams, work hard,
           and most importantly, a great father. Let me cite some things that made him great as an athlete.

            <dt id = "emphasize">  Mamba Mentality  </dt>
            <dd class = "deemphasize"> This mentality that Kobe Bryant has had helped him achieve great things in basketball. He won 5 championship with the same team which is the Lakers. He also won 2 olympic gold medals, and the 2008 olympic gold medal he has is the most remembered one because they were called as the "The Redeem Team" and Kobe led the team to win (they have a documentary in featured in Netflix called "The Redeem Team"). And this is the kind of mentality I want to practice.

            <dt id = "emphasize2"> Oscar Award Winner </dt>
            <dd class = "deemphasize2"> In 2018, Kobe Bryant became the first sportsperson and NBA player to win an Academy Award by his own work, a short film titled "Dear Basketball" and it was named as the Best Animated Short Film.</dd>
            <dt id = "emphasize3"> 81 point game </dt>
            <dd class = "deemphasize3">Back in January 22, 2006 (fun fact: it was my birthday as well!) the Los Angeles Lakers played the Toronto Raptors, and Kobe Bryant dropped 81 points! Second to Wilt Chamberlain's 100pt game. That night was memorable up until this day. Personally, I keep on watching the highlights of that game and it just feel so amazing.</dd> 
            <dt id = "emphasize4"> A great father figure </dt>
            <dd class = "deemphasize4"> This is just a personal perspective on how great Kobe was a father. He always spends time with his family if he's not working. During his last game before he retires, it was emotional, he mentioned that one of the reason why he's retiring is that he wants to make up the time lost because of work, and spend the rest of his retirement with his family. It is very inspirational.</dd>

            <p> <span class = "different"> Last January 26, 2020, an unfortunate event happened, Kobe died in a helicopter crash together with his daughter, Gigi. The world was affected, a lot of people that Kobe inspired, was very much affected, and I was one of them. His greatness made his legacy continue up to this day. He is still an inspiration to everyone nowadays. He is the G.O.A.T</span></p>
