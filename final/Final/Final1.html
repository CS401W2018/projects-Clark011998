        <h2>Basketball's Founding Father</h2>
        <p><em><strong>James Naismith was the founding father or basketball. He was born on November 6, 1861, in Almonte, Canada West, Province of Canada. Gifted in farm labour, Naismith spent his days outside playing catch, hide and seek, or duck on a rock, a medieval game. Orphaned in his early life, Naismith soon found that a soft lobbing shot was far more effective than a straight hard throw, a thought that later proved essential for the invention of basketball.</strong></em></p>
        
            
            
        <p><em><strong>The game of basketball as it is known today was created by Dr. James Naismith in December 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts, to condition young athletes during cold months. Naismith was a physical education instructor at YMCA International Training School (now known as Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts. Upon the request of his boss, Naismith was tasked to create an indoor sports game to help athletes keep in shape in cold weather. It consisted of peach baskets and a soccer style ball. He published 13 rules for the new game. He divided his class of eighteen into two teams of nine players each and set about to teach them the basics of his new game. The objective of the game was to throw the basketball into the fruit baskets nailed to the lower railing of the gym balcony. Every time a point was scored, the game was halted so the janitor could bring out a ladder and retrieve the ball. After a while, the bottoms of the fruit baskets were removed.</strong></em></p>
