       <h2>Basketball's First Game</h2>
        
       <p><em><strong>The first public basketball game was played in Springfield, Massachusetts, on March 11, 1892. And on December 21, 1891, Naismith published rules for a new game using five basic ideas and thirteen rules. That day, he asked his class to play a match in the Armory Street court: 9 versus 9, using a soccer ball and two peach baskets. Frank Mahan, one of his students, was not so happy. He just said: "Harrumph. Another new game". Someone proposed to call it "Naismith Game", but he suggested "We have a ball and a basket: why donâ€™t we call it basketball?"</strong></em></p><br>
