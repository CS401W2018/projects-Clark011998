    <h2>1. What kind of photos are good to encode using JPEG?</h2>
    <p> Pixels matter, like the size itself. I learned in class that 600px is good for the webpage, and it would also not take too much time to load and does not spend too much data for the users. </p>
    <h2>2. What kind of photos are good to encode using GIF?</h2>
    <p> Logos and icons are some the photos that are good to encode. GIF contains fewer colors, and simple graphics. </p>
    <h2>3. What is unique about the PNG format?</h2>
    <p>PNG format makes the image have a high quality display.</p>
    <h2>4. How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?</h2>
    <p>If we want to set a specific size we want, we can choose a size that is being offered in the site, or we can resize it using photoshop or any other apps that can resize image. We can also resize the image inside the VScode by using CSS.</p>
    <h2>5. Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of resizing it using CSS? </h2>
    <p>So that the quality stays the same. It could also help in the loading speed.</p>
