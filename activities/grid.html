        <h2>Engagement - 10/16/2024</h2>

        <h2>1. How much time should you spend on an engagement assignment after class?</h2>
        <p>Spend as much as you want. If you feel like you want to spend more hours after class, you can do it, if you feel like it helps you get better.
        </p>
        <h2>2. What should you focus on during class and after class?</h2>
        <p>Focus on the things that you think you are having a hard time with, and use every resource there is. We can also ask Brother Slade about it. Practice till we make it perfect.</p>
        <h2>3. What is the main difference between CSS Grid and CSS Flex?</h2>
        <p>The main difference between CSS Grid and CSS Flex is how they handle the layout we wanted.  And according to what I read, Grid is better than Flex.</p>
