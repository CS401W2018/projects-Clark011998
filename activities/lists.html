    <h2> What is the difference between OL and UL Tags? </h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p> OL - Order List makes the list rank things using numbers or letters, and if we want to use letters we simply type <!--<ol type = "a">-->

          <br>  UL - Unordered List makes the list put in a bullet point, making it just a regular list, like nothing in order. </p> </br>
