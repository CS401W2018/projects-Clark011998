    <h2>
        Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Absolute link - it could be other websites or even our own websites
        <br>
        Relative link - is your/our own website only.
        <br>
        We use relative links if we want to use our own work only. This will let the user see the work we have been doing.
    </p>
    <h2>Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?</h2>
    <p>No, links does not always have to be inside a NAV tag</p>

        <strong>List the 3 rules with relative links.</strong>
        <ol type = "1">
            <li> Periods (.) - means current folder </li>
            <li> Two Periods (..) - parent folder </li>
            <li> Slash (/) - meaning at the beginning, start at the root</li>
        </ol>
