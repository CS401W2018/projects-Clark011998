        <h3>1. What are the positives and negatives of hosting your videos on YouTube?</h3>
        <p>The positive side of using Youtube as our host is that it's free, and money-wise, it can help. Negative side is there are strict policies, and a lot of competition, and there is a possibility that you will loose onwership.</p>
        <h3>2. What is the most useful thing you can do with a transform?</h3>
        <p>The most useful thing that we can do with transform is that it will make our webpage enhance the visual interaction with the user.</p>
        <h3>3.How do you stay safe online?</h3>
        <p>I remembe this question that was asked in my IT 124 class, and I answered that by using strong passwords, we can also enable two-factor authentication, be sure to use secure websites, and update our software on a regular basis.</p>
        <h3>4. What is the schedule for the rest of the class?</h3>
