        <h1> Welcome to Web Development</h1>
        <h4> 
            What goes in the header?
        </h4>
        <p>
            The name of the company or group inside the webpage, and the search bar.
        </p>
        <h4> 
            What goes in the Nav? Can the Nav go in the header? Does it have to go in the header? Does the Nav contain links to another website?
        </h4>
        <p>
           Kind of like a subheader where the user can click it and it has a link to that specific portion that the webpage or the company offers.
           Nav can go to the header, but it does not have to. No, it does not contain links to another website that does not have anything to do with the company or group that owns the webpage.
        </p>
        <h4> 
            What goes in Main?
        </h4>
        <p>
           Everything that contains the webpage is what goes in Main. 
        </p>
        <h4> 
            What goes in the Footer?
        </h4>
        <p>
            more stuffs about the company. It could be a link to their services offered, or anything about the company. It also has the copyright section.
