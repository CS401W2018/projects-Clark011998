        <h3>1. Why don't we use the border property?</h3>
        <p>Because it is the old way of doing it, way before CSS. Which will also create a validation error.</p>
        <h3>2. What is the easiest way to color every other row a different color?</h3>
        <p>By coding inside the CSS. Making a "class" and call it like this ".schedule tbody tr:nth-child()" then inside the parenthesis, we can put a specific number of the row we wanted to have color, or we can also use the "even" and "odd" call outs.</p>
        <h3>3. When should we use a table?</h3>
        <p>When we want to display data that's naturally organized inside a cell, kind of look like a spreadsheet, which is really neat to view. Inside the table could be list of the movies and the cast in it, it could also be class attendance.</p>
