        <h2>1. What is the difference between a block and an inline tag? Give examples of each one.</h2>
        <p> Block tags are like big boxes that take up the width of the page, and they always start on a new line and push other content down. Inline tags are small portions that are inside a line, such as words or even images. Sample of block tags are div tags, paragraph tags, and h1 tags. And for Inline tag samples are span tag, a tag, and also strong tags.</p>
        <h2>2. What is normal flow in HTML?.</h2>
        <p>Normal flow in HTML refers to the default way elements are placed in the code. Like the ones we use to do before in class. It also defines how block and inline tags are placed in the code.</p>
        <h2>3. What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</h2>
        <p>Float is usually used inside the CSS file. It is used for positioning an element, it may be left or right. We need to clear the float so that it would not overlap over things.</p>
        <h2>4. What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</h2>
        <p>These are positioning methods, it allows us to move things as we want to inside the webpage. Absolute is placed in the nearest element or the page itself. Fixed is when we want the specific element to stay in the same place even when users scrolls through the webpage. Relative is positioned to where it normally would be, space is preserved in the layout.</p>
        <h2>5. How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</h2>
        <p>What I learned in class is that to make it nice is we have to make it simple and visible always, and also, we should make it stand out.</p>
        <h2>6. Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?</h2>
        <p>We can find it in the Lecture Notes section that is in Canvas specifically in the day where we discussed it.</p>
